# Yard-Wars


This is the github repository for my current project, Yard Wars. I am working with a small group of friends to create this game and hope to be a be to release it soon. Anyone checking this out, feel free to take a look at the projects board and take a look at our progress as we hope to complete this by March of 2021. 

This is going to be a multiplayer tower defense/offense game where you are children tasked with destroying the other teams fort. You will have many resources at your disposal to do this, from classes with special abilities, unique towers to fortify your base, and unique minions to attack with or defend against. I hope you are interested and we can't wait to see you in the Yard.
